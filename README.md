This project was for ECE243 - Computer Organization. The code for the car is capable of running in two modes: Autonomous, and Remote Controlled. 

In autonomous mode, the car is able to sense if it hit anything; when the car hits an obstacle, the car is able to reverse and turn left and continue to go straight after. In Autonomous mode, the program is also able to communicate with the monitor (using a VGA interface) and plot its position and where the obstacles are. 

In Remote Controlled mode, the car responds to a keyboard (PS2 interface) and is able to go forward, backward and turn either left or right.

The project is done primarily in assembly (Nios II) with some C extension.
